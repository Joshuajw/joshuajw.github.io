  As a person who has had little to no prior experience with javascript, I would say it's a fairly easy language to learn. Javascript seems like it would be the perfect beginning language for those who have had no coding experience, it's simple, easy to understand and easy to use. However, if you wanted to get closer to the CPU, a language such as C would be better suited.
  
  The WODs were very interesting, they remind me of the practical exams I would have in ICS 111. Although I realize the importance of being able to code functions off the top of your head, I feel that a relaxed environment where one can take his/her time writing code is better suited to get the creative juices flowing. When you have a set time limit, writing code can become stressful depending on the task. However stressful it may be, it does an effective job of making the student realize just how much he/she understands the content which is why, at this stage, I think they will work for me.
