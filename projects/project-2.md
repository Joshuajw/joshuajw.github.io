summary: A web application designed to help professors at UH Manoa lookup their class to see whether or not it was awarded a Focus credit.
---

I implemented this search function for the GenEd office at UH Manoa during my time as their student assistant. Before I worked for the GenEd the office they had another functioning search application, unfortunately, it stopped working before I became apart of their office. Once I joined the GenEd office as their studet assistant I heard of the hassles professors had to go through to check if their class was awarded a focus credit. Having previous experience working on websites, I proposed to create a new search funtion for them even though it wasn't apart of my student assistant duties. Previously, professors would have to download an excel spreadsheet and manually look for their class. The new search function I implemented for the GenEd office allows professors to use a search bar, in which they can type their name or class and have it pop up allowing for an easy search.
