summary: A version of Tetris I created using DLX and Logisim during my time in ICS 331
---

Having previously no experience with Assembly language or digital circuits, this project has by far been the most challenging yet fun project I have had to date. It involved the use of two programs: DLX Sim and Logisim. Logisim is a learning environment geared to teach digital circuits while DLX is an environment in which I can create and edit Assembly files. By combining these two programs I was able to develop my own version of tetris. Although not up to par with the actually tetris game, I learned a lot about assembly, circuits and the working parts of a CPU.
